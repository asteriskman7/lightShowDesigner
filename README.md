# lightShowDesigner
This project is a html5/javascript web site to facilitate the design 
of very simple light shows of the type commonly used as small scale 
christmas decorations.

The user will be able to:

* use their own background image and music by supplying a URL to load from
* add arbitrary shaped and colored lights
* set the on/off times for each light independently
* play the show as designed to the music
* export/import full design as text
* export show in at least the author's prefered format

The show is shown in schematic form, there is no high quality rendering.

All configuration data is saved to localstorage but ability to
export and import will be provided.
